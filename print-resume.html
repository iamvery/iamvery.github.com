<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
  My goal is to be a valuable partner to anyone I have the pleasure of working with.
  I strive to always work pragmatically, diligently, and efficiently.
  Always learning.
</p>

<h3>Thinking</h3>
<p>
  I have worked remotely, fulltime with a number of different companies.
  At different times, I have both contributed to and lead small, medium, and large projects with significant impact on business.
  These experiences have afforded me many opportunities to improve my product mindset and communication skills with both technical and business partners.
  I have also had ample opportunity to work in large, distributed, highly-available production systems leveraging different technology stacks.
  In addition to working on systems, I have frequently run engineering support and responded in real time to service interruptions related to both internal and external (3rd party) issues.
</p>

<h3>Speaking</h3>
<p>
  I am not actively pursuing speaking opportunities at this time.
  Instead, I am focusing on my family and home.
  In the past, I have had the opportunity to speak at a number of small to medium sized conferences, including:
  <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jay_hayes_remotely_productive_you_can_work_from_home">TEDx</a>,
  <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/oscon.html">OSCON</a>,
  <a href="https://railsconf.org/">RailsConf</a>,
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8MGNw045AE">ElixirConf</a>,
  and others.
</p>

<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>
I am extremely thankful for the opportunity and experience teaching the Ruby and Rails class at <a href="https://bignerdranch.com/">Big Nerd Ranch</a>.
  It not only made me a better programmer, it ignited an interest in mentoring others and has given me the realization that I have a real love of teaching and strong desire to continue doing it.

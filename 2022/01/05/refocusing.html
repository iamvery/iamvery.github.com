  Jan 05, 2022
</p>

<p>I haven’t posted much online in awhile. My last post here was mid-2019. You
see, 2019 was a transformational year for me. I backed off from speaking and
travel and focused my time and attention at home on my family. It has been
wonderful! As the year progressed, I realized that another significant source
of distraction for me was social media. It wasn’t doing me any good (and I
didn’t yet full appreciate how much bad it was doing). So I signed out, deleted
apps, and stopped using the services completely as the year rolled over to
2020.</p>

<p>On the subject of social media…</p>

<h2 id="a-problem">A Problem</h2>

<p>In my opinion social media is more bad than good. I sensed this was a generally
accepted sentiment way back in 2019 around the time I scaled back.  However,
the past couple years have brought to light how insidious major tech companies
can be, not to mention the power they wield. In this amount of time, we have
seen content moderation go from something you occasionally hear about in regard
to (terrible) things like pornography to significant personalities and
businesses being wiped off platforms for violating website “standards”, citing
violations of sharing certain information, the basis of which changes over
time.</p>

<p>Perhaps particular situations come to mind. Perhaps they are controversial to
you. Try to put our opinions of these specifics aside. Can we agree that having
these major tech companies move (sometimes in unison) to silence individuals
and businesses is problematic? Would you consider it problematic if it affected
information you agree with? Can we agree that this is a form of censorship?
And can we agree that there’s a notable bias in those who have been most
affected? Is that really OK?</p>

<p>I remember how my skin crawled when I read that Parler had been wiped off the
Internet, and it’s worth noting that I had barely even heard of it beforehand
(I was not a user). I wanted to hop into my company’s chat and share my outrage
with my coworkers. I wanted to post again on Twitter and other social media
accounts. Heck, I even wanted to shout on the street corner… But I didn’t.
Instead, I was quiet. Honestly, I was concerned about the chance that my
perception was wrong and someone would disagree with me. Perhaps I would get
some unwanted attention. I was afraid of what might happen if someone disagreed
with me. It was fear, and fear is not a virtue.</p>

<h2 id="your-voice">Your Voice</h2>

<p>You have perspective. You have opinions. You have a voice. And you have a
<strong>choice</strong> of when to speak, when to be quiet, and when to listen. Your
thoughts matter, and they should not be silenced. But again, it’s your choice
of how you use this voice, and there are consequences for the words you speak.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your words are so powerful that they will kill or give life, and the
talkative person will reap the consequences.
<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1849/PRO.18.21.TPT">Proverbs 18:21 TPT</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have decided that social media possesses no value for me personally, so I
will instead focus on those around me, the ones I do life with: my family, my
friends, my coworkers, etc.</p>

<h2 id="community">Community</h2>

<p>It’s probably worth investing real energy into researching and putting together
a dedicated post, but I want to at least mention how important community is in
our lives. This is the people around us. Those we do life with. Those you have
influence with. You can have real, heartfelt debates with people face-to-face.
Not yelling into the void of the Internet where everyone feels safe behind
their keyboards. In person, having discussions with respect and love is a
life-giving activity even when you do not agree. It helps us understand the
perspective and opinions of those with differing views. This is important. We
should be able to and even celebrate disagreement and more generally different
points of view without villainizing and labeling people. It’s how we learn from
one another. It’s a way of loving one another.</p>

<h2 id="a-call-to-action">A Call to Action</h2>

<p>What are we to do? I can’t tell you that. I decided to leave social media,
because it serves no purpose or value in my life. I do not have a large
following, and at this time I do not have any notable influence online. My
influence is in my community, and I believe that is the best place for me to
make investments. Your situation is different, and I would implore you to
really consider the “why” of your presence online, and if it’s right for you
then give it all you got! When it comes to these services online, I do believe
something needs to change. The reality is that these companies are more likely
to “feel” the affect of people migrating to other services than resigning en
masse. Healthy competition; free market. Either way, make sure you know why you
are doing what you are doing and do it (in love).</p>

<h2 id="an-aside-about-a-problem">An Aside About “A Problem”</h2>

<p>At the time, I didn’t have a great understanding of how tech companies were
able to get away with censorship, and perhaps I still don’t. It seems to all
come down to the so-called “Section 230”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Section 230 is a section of Title 47  of the United States Code enacted as
part of the United States  Communications Decency Act, that generally
provides immunity for website platforms with respect to third-party content.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That “immunity” seems not-good, but I’m no lawyer, so I won’t try to explain or
pick it apart. However, it does call attention again to the power of certain
companies.  While they may not be held legally liable for their users’ content,
they may themselves act like “the law” and act in unison to bring another
company all the way down, e.g. Parler. My best guess is they explained the
removal of this app by saying that “it violated our standards”. So they are
able to hold their “citizens” liable for its users’ content, but their own not
so much because they happen to own their infrastructure. Interesting. Is that
fair? Is that OK for services so fundamental as social media have become? What
if AT&amp;T were to decide to cut off tower access to Boost Mobile, because some
Boost customers were using their phones in a certain way?</p>

<h2 id="keep-in-touch">Keep in Touch</h2>

<p>I probably won’t be back on any of the social media sites any time soon, so if
you’d like to keep in touch you can send me an email at <a href="mailto:hello@iamvery.com">hello@iamvery.com</a>
or better yet let’s see one another in person somewhere. ❤️</p>

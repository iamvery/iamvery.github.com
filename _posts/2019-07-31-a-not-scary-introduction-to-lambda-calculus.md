Lambda calculus is a really interesting way of expressing computation with nothing more than functions of one argument.

Huge shout out to [Anjana Vakill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BsfMMYvGaU&t=2s) which this is based on.

You can find the source and other documents that made up this talk as [a Gist](https://gist.github.com/iamvery/64735212135da5c899881f6ec234c759).

This talk was given at [Florence JavaScript Engineers](https://www.meetup.com/Florence-Javascript-Engineers/).
It was a small, open group so it ran a little long, but hopefully it's interesting!
